# unpkg-package-manager

> offline first, fast af, package manager for the web

## Principles

- no semantic versioning (all versions are exact always)
- no dependency resolution (add all your deps as top level deps)
- downloads minimal set of files, manually specify additional in `upm.yml` if needed

## Usage

### `init`

- creates `upm.yml` file with defaults
- reads dependencies from `package.json` if one exists

### `install`

- installs dependencies and creates `upm-lock.yml` file.
- just install dependencies if `upm-lock.yml` exists

### `update`

- update all dependencies to their latest version
- update one dependency if an argument is provided
